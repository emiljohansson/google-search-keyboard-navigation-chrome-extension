> Chrome extension that adds keyboard navigation to Google Search.

Google Search recently removed Google Instant and with it, the keyboard functionality for desktop. This extension restores some of that navigation back to Search.

## Features

Using arrow up or down on your keyboard will select the first link in the list of results and allow navigation between all the results. The link is now focused so you can press enter to navigate to the url.

Typing any number or character between a-z will focus the search field and start a new word in the field.

The backspace key will focus the field and delete the last character in the field.

## Install

Under `chrome://extensions/`, select `Load unpacked extension...`, and select the `dist/` folder.
